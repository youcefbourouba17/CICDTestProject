# CICDTestProject  

## 🎯 Project Purpose  
The **CICDTestProject** demonstrates two main goals:  

1. **Frontend SPA Setup** → Show how to configure and run a frontend project as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** with a .NET backend.  
2. **CI/CD Automation** → Showcase a working **Continuous Integration & Deployment pipeline** using GitHub Actions and Docker.  

This makes the repo both a **learning tool** and a **portfolio-ready DevOps showcase**.

## 🖥️ 1. Run the Frontend with SPA Configured  

The project integrates a **frontend SPA** with a backend API.  

### 🔹 Steps to Run Locally  

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/youcefbourouba17/CICDTestProject.git
cd CICDTestProject
bash
Copy code
# Run the backend (C# / .NET)
dotnet run
bash
Copy code
# Run the frontend (TypeScript / JavaScript SPA)
cd frontend
npm install
👉 Once running, the backend serves as the API layer, and the SPA frontend consumes it.
The SPA configuration allows client-side routing while keeping a clean integration with the backend.

🔄 2. CI/CD Workflow
The project uses GitHub Actions to build, test, and deploy automatically.
Every push to the repository triggers the pipeline.

    H --> I[Notify Success ✅]
🔹 Pipeline Stages
Build → Compiles backend & frontend

Test → Runs automated unit/integration tests

Dockerize → Builds Docker image for consistent environments

Deploy → Pushes to target environment (e.g., staging/production)

⚡ This way, your README **teaches both how to run the project locally as a SPA** *and* **how CI/CD automation works with GitHub Actions & Docker**.  

Want me to also add the **exact GitHub Action workflow status badges** (Build, Tests, Docker) at the top of the README so it looks pro right away?
